### RoNGBa: A Robustly Optimized Natural Gradient Boosting Training Approach with Leaf Number Clipping

This is a course project rushed in a weekend with the outcome of the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02338). The code is mostly the same as [the original ngboost repository](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ngboost), except for minor changes on the hyperparameters and the learner settings.


Simply run the following command: 

```
bash run.sh
```
to reproduce the results reported in our preprint.
